#Problem Definition:
For Public Sector and Government Agencies, with millions of documents, a document management system is becoming a mandate to organize, index and control theirdocuments in a hassle-free manner.
Public Sector and Government Agencies deal withDocuments which range from Public View documents, Tenders, to the most Confidential and Secret Documentswhich are intended only for view of certain designated personnel.
Storing all these documents as physical records not just consumes a lot of space but also is a tedious affair to filethese documents and manage them safely with restricted access.

So,we are making all services digital. In this project we are using local server for now for storing the necessary documents for 10 peoples for demo. The particular documents we can use where they become necessary. We are using RFID Reader for scanning particular person in this there are also chances of fraud. This we can overcome using Fingerprint sensor. Suppose I for opening a account in bank I have to just carry a RFID tag. The bankers will scan that card and also check fingerprint. All the necessary documents will get display there without carrying.
